<h2>WeSport</h2>

A site for people to find a tennis partner.

<h3>Approach</h3>

Planning and prioritising of features was recorded using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/mZGk6ltX/project-3).

[User Stories](http://localhost:3000/docs/user-stories.md) and [Wireframes](https://www.gliffy.com/go/html5/9084439?app=1b5094b0-6042-11e2-bcfd-0800200c9a66) were created once the initial site setup was done and the scope of the project was clearer than immediately after deciding which idea to use.

Trello was updated daily to keep track of work planned for the day, final update at the end of the project to clarify what was achieved and which ideas could be implemented in the future.

Tasks were divided between the team members with some paired coding.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Node</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Mongoose</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Moment</li>
<li>BCrypt</li>
<li>EJS</li>
<li>CSS on top of Materialize</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Onboarding Process</h3>

Use of the site depends on a user being registered and logged in so the login form is prominent on the index page with a clear link to the registration form for new users. The heading above the login form succinctly clarifies the site's purpose and invites a user to join. Once registered and logged in, users are taken straight to the calendar page.

<h3>Installation and Deployment</h3>

The site should be usable immediately.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Displaying correct dates before the first of the month.</li>
<li>Dates in seed-data all convert to 01/01/1970 - needs to be fixed so bookings can be displayed in the calendar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Modal in Materialize to show information about other users when the active user clicks on a date in the calendar.</li>
<li>A fuller introduction to the site so new users have a clear idea what they'd be signing up for if they register.</li>
<li>Email feature possibly using NodeMailer so users can contact a potential tennis partner.</li>
<li>More than one venue for users to choose from.</li>
</ul>
